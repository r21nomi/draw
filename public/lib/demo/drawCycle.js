/**
 * The draw-then-bake cycle every freehand demo shares.
 *
 * Wires a DrawInput to a stage and a DrawingBoard: the drawn points are split
 * into pieces wherever the direction turns abruptly, each piece is lightly
 * smoothed, `build` turns it into a mesh, the pointer's own path shows as a one
 * pixel black line while drawing, and the finished pieces bake into the board.
 * The splitting means fast zigzag squiggling bakes as separate strokes, one per
 * leg, instead of one folded line. While the stage's wireframe overlay is on,
 * the last baked mark keeps its wireframe, as plain black lines, until the next
 * mark starts.
 *
 * `build(path, points, seed)` receives one piece's smoothed path, its raw
 * points (which carry pressure), and the piece's seed, and returns
 * `{ mesh, renderer }` or null.
 *
 * The pointer is one source of strokes, not the only one: the returned `feed`
 * takes (points, done) exactly as the pointer produces them, so a replay or a
 * generated stroke runs through the same cycle. `onCommit(points, seed)` fires
 * once per piece after it bakes, with the raw points that made it, so a
 * recorded piece replays as its own stroke; `onRelease()` fires once after all
 * of a gesture's pieces have committed. `split` sets the turn threshold and
 * measurement window ({ angle, span }), or `false` to draw unsplit.
 * `pointerTrace` shows or hides the pointer's own line; the returned
 * `setPointerTrace` changes it later. `onFeed(points, done, seed)` fires at the
 * start of every feed with the gesture's seed, so a mirror on another machine
 * can rebuild the same marks; the returned `setSeed` aligns the gesture seed
 * with a source, and `seed` reads it.
